i.You cannot use pointers in Java, but in C++ you can. 
  There are pointers in Java, but you cannot write a programa
  that using pointers directly, while in C++ you can

ii.Java is independient from the platform, while C++ is not.
    As the compilation if Java is made in the virtual machine,
    it does not depend on the machine that is written the program

iii.C++ is only compiled, while Java is bath compiled and interpreted.
    This means that a C++ program needs to be compiled to check all the errors,
    while in Java you can check them whiler writing

iv.In Java, all the calls ara by reference, while in C++ you can by value too
    as in Java everything is pointed by a pointer which you always use to refer to
    an object, while in C++ you can make the call to the real value of a variable.

v.In C++ you can is closer to the hardware, so you can allocate memory, 
    while in Java you are further from the memory and its mangement is done by 
    the garbage collector which means the user does not need to worry about the memory

PROGRAMS WRITTEN IN C++

i.Adobe systems, probably these benefits from the capability of the memory management as in programas like photosop this resource is very important
 
ii.Microsoft office, again, as the memory is very important in document mangament porgrams, is a really good choice to use C++ for its memory management

iii.MongoDB, I think that this makes obviuos that if you want to make programs that handle memory precisely, you should use C++ as all the programs I have mentioned use it because they need this kind of feature to be made.
